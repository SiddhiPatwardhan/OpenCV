# OpenCV Learning Repository 📸🧠

## 🔍 What is OpenCV?

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains over 2500 optimized algorithms for real-time image and video processing. With OpenCV, developers can perform tasks like object detection, face recognition, edge detection, and more.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains **my complete learning journey of OpenCV**, structured into **9 chapters**, each focusing on a specific core concept of computer vision.

- Each chapter is organized in a **separate notebook/file**.
- Every chapter includes:
  - ✅ **Code Implementation**
  - 💬 **Commented Explanations** (within the code)
- The repo is intended to be **beginner-friendly** — ideal for anyone starting with OpenCV.

> 🔄 **All images, videos, and additional test resources** used in these projects are placed in the `resources/` folder for easy access.

> ⚠️ Don’t worry if some of the last chapters have slightly longer code! Everything is written with **clear logic**, and the main focus is on **understanding the concept**, not just the code size.
